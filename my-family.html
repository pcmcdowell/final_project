			<h3>About My Immediate Family</h3>
			<p>I grew up with my mom, my two older sisters, and my grandma.</p>
			<p>When I was in the seventh grade, my mom met my step-dad. They married in late 2006, and I gained two older step-sisters.</p>
			<p>My current immediate family includes myself, my two sisters, my mom and step-dad, his two daughters, my niece, my boyfriend, my son, my step-brother-in-law, and my two step-nephews, plus one more on the way.</p>

			<p>I think it's safe to say that holidays were never boring growing up.</p>

			<h3>Starting My Own Family</h3>
			<p>This is my family. I love them so much. My husband and I have been together for six years, but we were friends for a year prior to getting together.</p>
			<p>We enjoy talking to each other and going on long walks. We always try to best the other in everything we do together.</p>
			<p>We now have a loving son who is the pride and joy of our lives. His name is MALAKI and we both couldn't live without him.</p>
			<br>
			<p>This is my son. He's a handful most days, but I love him.</p>
				<img src="pictures/malaki.jpg" class="malaki">
			<br>
			<p>He enjoys watching Disney movies (I've trained him well), and his favorite television show is now P.A.W. Patrol, although he changes it every few months.</p>
			<p>He loves sports, mainly soccer, but mostly he likes to just kick any kind of ball around or throw one.</p>
			<p>His favorite toy is either his Ironman action figure, because he thinks Ironman is an awesome superhero, or his P.A.W. Patrol lookout tower.</p>
			<p>He really likes the dogs in that show because he really likes dogs.</p>
			<p>He also really enjoys watching sports, mostly the Giants or 49ers thanks to my two sisters.</p>
			<p>Every now and then he'll watch soccer with me, but he mostly likes to play it rather than watch it.</p>
