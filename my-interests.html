			<h2>These are my interests!</h2>
			<div class="col-md-12">
				<p>My interests in music, I feel, are pretty eclectic. I'll listen to almost anything, from Britney Spears to Eminem to Carrie Underwood to Disney soundtracks.</p>
					<img src="pictures/headphones.jpg" class="music">
				<p>When it comes to television, I like watching a lot of different shows, but my favorite genre is crime shows. I love Criminal Minds and CSI, but only the original in Vegas.</p>
				<p>I like Criminal Minds because it takes a different view on crime solving.</p>
				<p>It follows an FBI division trying to solve serial murders. Most crime shows follow the evidence of a case.</p>
				<p>This show finds the criminal by still following the evidence but to figure out why the killer does what he does.</p>
				<p>They follow the signature to find the killer</p>
					<img src="pictures/criminal-minds.jpg" class="criminal">
				<p>I like CSI because it shows more of the behind-the-scenes with the investigations.</p>
				<p>It shows the lab work and the foot work that is used to catch people, as well a lot of other stuff.</p>
				<p>Plus, the show started not too long after my grandparents retired to Las Vegas and we went to visit them for the first time.</p>
				<p>I've also been known to watch Cold Case and Law and Order: SVU.</p>
				<br><br>
				<p>Now, to be honest, I am a big kid. I absolutely love love LOVE Disney movies. I could watch them all day long.</p>
					<img src="pictures/disney.jpg" class="disney">
				<p>My favorite Disney movies are: The Princess and the Frog, Frozen, and Tangled.</p>
				<p>These are my favorites because, to me, they are like the next generation of Disney movies because these are the first ones where the princess isn't helpless and shows that true love's kiss isn't needed to break the spell.</p>
				<p>The Princess and the Frog shows that women are strong and don't need men to achieve their dreams.</p>
				<p>It also shows that hard work and dedication will pay off in the end; life isn't a fairytale.</p>
					<img src="pictures/princess.jpg" class="princess">
				<p>I like Frozen because it's the first Disney movie that shows the first man you meet won't always be Prince Charming.</p>
				<p>It also shows that family is always there for you no matter what happens,and true love doesn't have to be shown by a kiss or a lover.</p>
					<img src="pictures/olaf.jpg" class="olaf">
				<p>I love Tangled because it shows new ways to use kitchen items. LOL</p>
				<p>It also shows that you don't always have love at first sight. It's usually getting to know someone and their personality, spending time with them, and then falling in love.</p>
					<img src="pictures/tangled.jpg" class="tangled">
				<p>I don't discriminate against other animated movies. I do like Despicable Me and How to Train Your Dragon as well.</p>

			<h2>How I Became Interested In This Field</h2>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-12">
			<p>My boyfriend is a computer geek, in that he loves to learn new things about the technology computers, and currently we are building a desktop together.</p>
			<p>When we met, he started teaching me about the hardware of computers. He taught me about all the specifications of each piece and which one is better for performance.</p>
			<p>Then, I wanted to learn more about the software behind the hardware.</p>
			<p>My sister introduced me to this program because she heard about it through a friend.</p>
			<p>Once I got here, the rest was history.</p>
