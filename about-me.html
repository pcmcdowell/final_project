					<h2>About Me!!!</h2>
					<p>Hello. My name is Patricia and I am twenty-three years old.</p>
				</div>
				<div class="col-md-12">
					<p>I was born and raised in San Francisco on Merced Ave near Forest Hill Muni station and the very popular West Portal.</p>

					<h3 class="school">School Years</h3>
					<p>I went to St. Brendan on Ulloa St. for grammar school.</p>
					<p>For high school I went to Washington High, and then I transferred to Terra Nova High in Pacifica when I moved to Daly City.</p>
					<p>Now, I currently attend Skyline College, as well as Hackbright Academy.</p>

					<h3 class="favorites">My Favorites</h3>
					<p>My favorite color is <span>purple</span> and my favorite place is the beach. I love the sound of the waves crashing onto the beach.</p>
					<p>My favorite holidays are Christmas, because it really brings my family together like no other holiday, and Halloween, because who doesn't like an excuse to get free candy?.</p>
					<p>My favorite thing to do is either curling up on the couch with a good book and some hot chocolate in the winter, or watching a Disney movie.</p>
					<p>My favorite weeks of the year are Shark Week, because sharks are beautiful, misunderstood creatures, and Fleet Week. The Blue Angels are amazing!</p>
					<p>My favorite sport is soccer, because I've been playing soccer on and off since I was in Kindergarten, and my favorite team is FC Barcelona. Lionel Messi is my favorite player on this team.</p>
					<p>I also really like the SF Giants, and occasionally I like to watch the SF 49ers.</p>
